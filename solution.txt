1. Create a new repo in GitHub. Name IronNadin

2. Clone that repo to your computer

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git clone https://github.com/nadbrunn3/IronNadin.git

3. Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. (You can use the command line: touch nameOfTheFile.txt). 

4. Add and commit the changes to git

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % touch aboutNadin.txt

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git add aboutNadin.txt

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git commit -m "Created a new file"

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % echo "Hi there! .....e" >> aboutNadin.txt

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git add aboutNadin.txt

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git commit -m "Added a fun fact of myself to the file"

5. Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git remote add origin https://github.com/nadbrunn3/	IronNadin.git

	(base) steib@Steibs-MBP lab2 % git push origin master


PAIR Programming Exercise: 

1. Fork your classmate's repository.

2. Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.

3. Create a new branch named classmate.

4. Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.

5. Add the changes to the git.

6. Commit and push the changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub, inside the forked repository.

7. Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.

8. Merge the branch your classmate created. Now everyone's repos should have the original file (about.txt) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.
